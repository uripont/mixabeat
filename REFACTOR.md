- [ ] Opening index.html with invalid token redirects to landing
- [ ] Opening index.html with valid token redirects to room selection
```javascript
// Expected console logs in auth.js:
// "Checking auth state..."
// "No token found, showing landing" OR
// "Token invalid, showing landing" OR
// "Valid token found, redirecting to room selection"
```

#### Login Flow

```

#### Signup Flow

// "Redirecting to room selection..."
```

#### Protected Route Access
- [ ] Try accessing room.html directly with no token redirects to landing
- [ ] Try accessing room.html with invalid token redirects to landing
- [ ] Try accessing room.html with valid token allows access
```javascript

// "Checking auth for room access..."
// "Auth check failed, redirecting to landing" OR
// "Auth valid, initializing room selection..."
```

### Room Selection Tests

#### Room List

// "Auto-refresh: fetching room list..."
```

```

#### Room Joining
- [ ] Click "Join" on room card joins the room
- [ ] Search for non-existent room shows error
- [ ] Search for existing room by name joins the room
```javascript

// "Room found/not found"
// "Join successful/failed"
```

#### WebSocket Connection

- [ ] WebSocket reconnects on connection loss
```javascript
// Expected console logs in websocket.js:
// "Initializing WebSocket connection..."

// "Connection lost, attempting reconnect..."
```

## Next Steps in Refactor
1. Create landing page
2. Implement room interface components
3. Add user settings panel
4. Implement audio upload functionality

## Notes
- All HTTP requests should include appropriate headers
- All forms should show loading states during API calls
- Error messages should auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- WebSocket should attempt reconnection up to 5 times
